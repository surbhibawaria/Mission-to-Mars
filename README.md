# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

A junior Data Scientist Robin does freelance astronomy work in her spare time. Her dream is to land a position with NASA someday. So she spends a lot of time visiting sites with news about space exploration, especially the mission to Mars. One day, while reading an article about how much water the red planet may have had in its youth, she has an idea to write a script that would gather all the information she searches for into one convinient location, and once she gathered it, she could show it off to other Astrofiles. She wants to gather data about the mission to Mars from all over the web and display it in a central location without spending her free time gathering the data manually. Instead, she plans to build a web application that will scrape new data every time she tells it to, with a click of a button. 

### Purpose

To use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
